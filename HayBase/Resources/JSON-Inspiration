The soft, draped headboard is counterbalanced by the generously dimensioned steel tubing frame, creating a contemporary and comfortable bed-sofa hybrid that is not intended exclusively for sleeping, but also as a foundation for reading, working, or watching TV and other activities. With a flat-packed, easy-to-assemble design, removable headboard cover and recyclable materials, functionality has been factored in every step of the design process.",

One of Friso Kramer's most famous designs, the Revolt Chair embodies his distinctive minimalist style; a revolutionary design and choice of materials that uses a bent sheet steel frame instead of a traditional tubular frame. Reproduced today using the same process, the chair retains the functionality and resilient construction of its mid-century precursor, but in a sustainable material choice comprising a mix of recycled post-consumer and virgin ABS material in different colour options. A dynamic and flexible chair, Revolt's ergonomic design moves with its user, offering active support while working, eating or sitting in conferences. Its comfort, durability and timeless aesthetics make it suitable for using in a wide variety of private, corporate or public spaces.",

Crafted in aluminium with a wet spray satin finish to create a smooth surface, it utilises a standard retro fit bulb, hidden away behind the lamp's acrylic diffuser, which softly distributes the light.",
