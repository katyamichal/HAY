The soft, draped headboard is counterbalanced by the generously dimensioned steel tubing frame, creating a contemporary and comfortable bed-sofa hybrid that is not intended exclusively for sleeping, but also as a foundation for reading, working, or watching TV and other activities. With a flat-packed, easy-to-assemble design, removable headboard cover and recyclable materials, functionality has been factored in every step of the design process.",
